I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href='https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/english'>Department of Computer Science</a>, KU Leuven, mentored by <a href="https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/DannyHughes" target="_blank">Prof. Danny Hughes</a>. My research primarily focuses on hardware-software co-design for energy-aware ultra-low power embedded systems, sustainability, energy harvesting and near-sensor processing for industrial IoT.

I have over 9 years of industry experience in the automotive sector as an architect and software engineer for infotainment, telematics and intelligent map based ADAS systems. I enjoy working in safety-critical systems and I'm always happy to see that the products that I am involved in some way, is saving peoples lives.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from KU Leuven under the supervision of <a href="https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/DannyHughes" target="_blank">Prof. Danny Hughes</a>. My PhD focused on energy-aware ultra-low power IoT sensors with near-sensor processing capabilities targeting Industry 4.0 applications. I hold a masters from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore and a Bachelors from SASTRA University, India.
