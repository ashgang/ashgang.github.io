I am a postdoctoral researcher in KU Leuven, Department of Computer Science mentored by Prof. Danny Hughes. My research primarily focuses on hardware-software co-design of energy-aware ultra-low power embedded systems, sustainability, energy harvesting and near-sensor processing for industrial IoT. 

I have over 9 years of industry experience in the automotive sector as an architect and software engineer for infotainment, telematics and intelligent map based ADAS systems. I enjoy working in safety-critical systems and always happy to know that the products that I am involved in some way saves peoples lives.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from KU Leuven under the supervision of <a href="https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/DannyHughes" target="_blank">Prof. Danny Hughes</a>. My PhD focused on energy-aware ultra-low power IoT sensors with near-sensor processing capabilities targeting Industry 4.0 applications. I hold a masters from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore and a Bachelors from SASTRA University, India.
