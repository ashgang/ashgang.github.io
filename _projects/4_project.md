This project presents a hybrid platform, which can opportunistically run when harvested energy is available and has a reliable fallback with a primary battery. It is designed to harvest energy from Radio-Frequency tuned for 868MHz, and includes an nRF52840 application processor that also has 7 different PHY capabilities. This project is intented to provide easy entry to RF energy harvesting with everything required on-board.
