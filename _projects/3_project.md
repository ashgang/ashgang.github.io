In this project, we are trying to build a battery-free smart phone with a range of applications. The notion of having a battery-free interactives devices with a low power network poses many challenges such as responsiveness, quick charge capability, battery lifetime (or how long the device can run on single charge) and limited bandwidth. Advancement in codec technologies have enabled extremely low bit rate audio transmission (3kbps) which is achievable in these low bandwidth networks.
