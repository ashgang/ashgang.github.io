We are excited to share that our paper, "BioPulse: Towards Enabling Perpetual Vital Signs Monitoring Using a Body Patch," has been accepted for presentation at HotMobile 2025. Additionally, the accompanying poster, "Towards Enabling Perpetual Vital Signs Monitoring Using a Body Patch," will be showcased during the poster session.

Looking forward to engaging discussions and feedback at the conference!
